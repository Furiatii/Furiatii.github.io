  "about.title": "About me",
  "about.p1": "I study Water Resources and Environmental Engineering at UFF (8th semester) and work as an Analyst at INEA's Water Security Division (GERSEG), covering both fronts: hydrological monitoring (SERVHIDR) and dam safety (SERVRISB).",
  "about.p2": "I started as an intern doing data consistency checks and drought study support. When I saw the team spending hours manually collecting data from multiple sources, I built Python scrapers that solved the problem. Since then, I've been applying automation, dashboards, and AI to the division's workflow.",
  "about.p3": "Outside INEA, I'm President of Agrha Consultoria (UFF's environmental consulting junior enterprise) and a FEC research fellow, working as a data analyst on rural settlement research using INCRA Census 2025 data.",
  "about.p4": "My goal is to apply this profile to bigger challenges: using data, automation, and AI to solve real engineering problems.",
